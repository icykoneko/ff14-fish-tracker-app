title:  "Patch 6.5 Updates"
---

The tracker has the new fish added in Patch 6.5, but as always, the exact conditions for catching them are still being discovered.
The tracker is manually updated to reflect the latest findings about every night.
Remember to use the Fish'cord to coordinate research into the latest fishies! Good luck!

By default, new fish are not displayed to avoid potential spoilers. If you want to see them now, just click the gear icon in the top-right and add the patch to the filter.

As a reminder, I'm unable to determine the specific restrictions on any fish now, so you will see "Weather Unknown" and "Time Unknown" for any fish with missing information.
This does not necessarily mean the fish as a weather or time restriction, so please keep that in mind when testing for conditions.
