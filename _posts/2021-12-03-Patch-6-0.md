title:  "Endwalker"

Welcome back everyone! The tracker has been updated with all of the new fish you can catch in Endwalker.

This time, I've made a few adjustments to how the site initially loads. First, fish that are always up are filtered out by default. Second, you should have seen a message if you've used this site before telling you the Endwalker fish are filtered out by default as well. Since the locations for these fish could contain spoilers, you will have to use the gears icon in the top right to adjust the patch filters to view the new fish.

Please note that the Fish Guide was also updated. If you don't want to be spoiled, you should avoid using it for now.

Fish Eyes now works on all non-legendary fish prior to Shadowbringers.

The exact conditions for catching the new fish are still being discovered.
The tracker is manually updated to reflect the latest findings about every night.
Remember to use the Fish'cord to coordinate research into the latest fishies! Good luck!
