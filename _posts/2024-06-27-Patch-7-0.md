Welcome back everyone! The tracker has been updated with all of the new fish you can catch in Dawntrail.

Just like last expansion, the site will not immediately show any of the new fish unless you ask.  This will remain in effect for the first four weeks of Dawntrail, afterwhich, all fish will be displayed for new and returning visitors. You should have seen a message if you've used this site before telling you the Dawntrail fish are filtered out by default as well. Since the locations for these fish could contain spoilers, you will have to use the gears icon in the top right to adjust the patch filters to view the new fish.

Please note that the Fish Guide was also updated. If you don't want to be spoiled, you should avoid using it for now. The aforementioned filters don't apply to the fish guide, sorry.

The exact conditions for catching the new fish are still being discovered.
The tracker is manually updated to reflect the latest findings about every night.
Remember to use the Fish'cord to coordinate research into the latest fishies! Good luck!
