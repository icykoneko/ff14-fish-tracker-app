# Adjustments to current data, designed for quick updates without rebuilding
# the entire data.js file.
#
# The goal is to allow updates from anywhere!
#
# Example:
# - name: <FISH_NAME_EN>
#   startHour: [0-23]
#   endHour: [1-24]
#   previousWeatherSet: [<WEATHER_NAME_EN>,<WEATHER_NAME_EN>*]
#   weatherSet: [<WEATHER_NAME_EN>,<WEATHER_NAME_EN>*]
#   bait: [<BAIT_NAME_EN>,<BAIT_NAME_EN>*]
#   tug: (light|medium|heavy)
#   hookset: (Precision|Powerful)
#   snagging: (true|false)
#   fishEyes: (true|false|<TIME_IN_SECS>)
#   lure: (Ambitious|Modest)
#
# This does not support intuition at the moment...
#
# DON'T FORGET TO INCORPORATE THESE CHANGES INTO REAL fishData.yaml.
# Just... ignore the fact that file lives on the master branch, while this one
# lives in the gh-pages branch... Carby says it's fine.
